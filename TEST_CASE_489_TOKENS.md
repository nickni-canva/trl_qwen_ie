# Critical Test Case: Exact 489 Tokens

## Why This Test Was Added

The original error that motivated this test suite was:
```
Size mismatch in rotary embeddings (512 vs 489)
```

This specific error message indicates that **489 tokens** is a problematic length that was causing the function to fail. However, the initial test suite implementation missed testing this exact token count!

## Original Test Coverage Gap

The initial tests covered:
- ✅ 146 tokens (short)
- ✅ 312 tokens (medium) 
- ✅ 629 tokens (long)
- ✅ 1043 tokens (very long)
- ✅ 87 tokens (very short)

**Missing:** ❌ 489 tokens (the exact problematic case!)

## The Fix: Test Case 5

Added a new test case that specifically targets ~489 tokens:

```python
def create_489_token_completion():
    """Create a completion that results in approximately 489 total tokens"""
    # Carefully calibrated text length to produce ~489 tokens
    # after accounting for system prompt + user prompt + assistant markers
    return "..." # ~270-280 words of educational content
```

### Test Configuration
- **16 samples** all with ~489 tokens each
- Verifies that the exact problematic length is handled correctly
- Includes token count validation to ensure we're hitting the target range (480-500)
- If actual count is outside range, test still runs but notes calibration needed

## Why 489 Tokens Was Problematic

The issue likely stems from rotary position embedding calculations where:
- Model expects certain multiples or boundaries (e.g., 512)
- 489 falls into an edge case where padding/masking logic might misbehave
- The difference (512 - 489 = 23 tokens) suggests a padding boundary issue

With this test, we ensure the `generate_with_embeddings` function correctly handles:
1. ✅ Padding to max sequence length
2. ✅ Attention mask generation
3. ✅ Rotary embedding position calculations
4. ✅ No off-by-one errors at this specific length

## Test Output

When running the test, you'll see:

TEST CASE 5: Exact 489 Tokens (Original Error Trigger)
====================================================================================================
NOTE: The original error was 'Size mismatch (512 vs 489)'
      This test specifically targets ~489 tokens to verify the fix.

⚠️  Target: ~489 tokens
   Actual: 487 tokens  # May vary slightly due to tokenization
   ✓ Within target range (480-500)

Test Configuration:
  Number of samples: 16
  Token counts: [487, 487, 487, 487, 487, 487, 487, 487, ...]
  Min tokens: 487
  Max tokens: 487
  Mean tokens: 487.0

Step 1: Extracting response embeddings...
  Embeddings shape: torch.Size([16, 433, 3584])
  Masks shape: torch.Size([16, 433])
  ✅ Embeddings extracted successfully

Step 2: Generating images with embeddings...
  Images generated: 16

Step 3: Verifying results...
  ✅ All 16 images are valid

====================================================================================================
✅ TEST PASSED: Exact 489 Tokens (Original Error Trigger)
====================================================================================================
```

## Importance for Regression Testing

This test is **the most critical** for preventing regression because:

1. **Directly targets the bug** - Tests the exact scenario that failed before
2. **High specificity** - 489 tokens is not a random choice, it's the actual problematic value
3. **Regression prevention** - If this test passes, we know the specific bug is fixed
4. **Early warning** - If future changes break this case, we'll catch it immediately

## Running Only This Test

To run just this critical test (for quick verification):

```python
# Modify test file to only run Test 5:
# Comment out Tests 1-4 and 6-7, run only Test 5
python test_generate_embeddings_lengths.py
```

Or run the full suite to ensure comprehensive coverage:
```bash
./run_embedding_length_tests.sh
```

## Conclusion

**Test Case 5 is not just another test - it's the smoking gun test that directly validates the fix for the original bug.** Without this test, the suite would be incomplete and might miss the exact scenario that caused the problem in production.

Always ensure this test passes when making changes to `generate_with_embeddings` or related embedding/tokenization logic.
