# Complete Guide: GRPO Training for Qwen-Image-Edit-Response

## üéØ What This Does

Trains **Qwen2.5-VL** to generate better image editing descriptions using GRPO reinforcement learning.

- **Input**: Image + editing instruction ("add a rainbow to the sky")
- **VLM output**: Description of how to edit ("The sky is blue. Add a colorful rainbow arc...")
- **Diffusion output**: Edited image with the rainbow
- **Reward**: GPT-4V judges if the edit is good
- **Learning**: VLM improves its descriptions based on rewards

### Training
- **Model**: Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct
- **Method**: GRPO with LoRA (r=32, Œ±=64)
- **Batch size**: 1 per GPU √ó 2 accumulation = 16 effective

- **Frozen**: DiT transformer (only VLM is trained)

## üî¨ Algorithm Details

### The GRPO Loop

```python
for batch in dataset:
    # 1. VLM generates completion (text description)
    completion = vlm.generate(image, instruction)
    
    # 2. Extract embeddings from completion
    embeddings = forward_pass(vlm, completion)
    
    # 3. Generate edited image
    edited_img = diffusion(image, embeddings)
    
    # 4. Evaluate with GPT-4V
    reward = gpt_eval(input_img, edited_img, instruction)
    
    # 5. Update VLM via GRPO
    vlm.update(reward)
```

### Embedding Extraction (Option C)

**Problem**: GRPO generates text but doesn't return embeddings.

**Solution**: Do a forward pass on the generated text.

```python
# GRPO gives us:
completion_text = "The image shows a beach. To add a sunset..."

# We do:
full_prompt = f"<|im_start|>system\n....<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\n{instruction}<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n{completion_text}<|im_end|>"

outputs = vlm(full_prompt, image, output_hidden_states=True)
embeddings = outputs.hidden_states[-1]  # Shape: [batch, seq_len, hidden_dim]

# Drop system prompt (first 64 tokens after padding)
embeddings = embeddings[:, num_padding+64:]
```

**Why this works**:
- Forward pass is deterministic
- Uses GRPO's exact completion text
- No regeneration needed
- Embeddings match what was generated

### Reward Function

**Alignment** (60%):
```
"Does the edited image follow the instruction?"
Rates: 0.0 (not at all) to 1.0 (perfectly)
```

**Quality** (40%):
```
"Is the edited image high quality?"
Considers: realism, coherence, artifacts
Rates: 0.0 (poor) to 1.0 (excellent)
```

**Combined**:
```python
reward = 0.6 * alignment_score + 0.4 * quality_score
```

## üéì Key Insights

### 1. Only VLM is Trained

```python
# VLM (text_encoder)  ‚Üê Trained with GRPO + LoRA
# DiT (transformer)   ‚Üê Frozen (no gradients)
# VAE                 ‚Üê Frozen

pipe.text_encoder = trained_vlm  # Replace with GRPO-updated model
```

**Why**:
- VLM learns to generate better descriptions
- DiT already knows how to edit images
- Training DiT would be slow and unstable

### 2. Text First, Embeddings Second

**Old approach** (buggy):
- Try to extract embeddings during generation
- Mismatches between GRPO's text and our embeddings
- Complex verification logic

**New approach** (clean):
- GRPO generates text
- We do forward pass on that text
- Extract embeddings
- Use for diffusion

### 3. No Regeneration

**Problem with regeneration**:
```python
# GRPO generates: "The sky is blue..."
grpo_text = grpo.generate()

# We regenerate: "The clouds are white..."
our_text = vlm.generate()  # Different!

# Embeddings don't match original generation
embeddings = extract(our_text)  # Wrong!
```

**Our solution**:
```python
# GRPO generates
grpo_text = grpo.generate()

# We use exact same text
our_embeddings = forward_pass(grpo_text)  # Correct!
```

### 4. Embedding Concatenation

**Before** (without response):
```
[SYSTEM PROMPT] [USER + INSTRUCTION]
     ‚Üì drop        ‚Üì keep
                [USER + INSTRUCTION] ‚Üí embeddings
```

**After** (with response):
```
[SYSTEM PROMPT] [USER + INSTRUCTION] [ASSISTANT + COMPLETION]
     ‚Üì drop        ‚Üì keep                ‚Üì keep
                [USER + INSTRUCTION + ASSISTANT + COMPLETION] ‚Üí embeddings
```

The concatenated embeddings give the diffusion model:
- What to change (instruction)
- How to change it (completion)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### OOM (Out of Memory)

**Symptoms**: `CUDA out of memory` error

**Solutions**:
1. Reduce `per_device_train_batch_size` (currently 1)
2. Reduce `num_generations` (currently 8 ‚Üí try 4)
3. Reduce `gradient_accumulation_steps` (currently 2 ‚Üí try 1)

### Slow Training

**Symptoms**: Very slow progress

**Solutions**:
1. Check GPU utilization: `nvidia-smi -l 1`
2. Verify all 8 GPUs are being used
3. Check DeepSpeed is active (look for ZeRO logs)

### API Rate Limits

**Symptoms**: GPT evaluation fails frequently

**Solutions**:
1. Reduce `n_evals` (currently 3 ‚Üí try 1)
2. Add retries with exponential backoff
3. Use a higher-tier OpenAI plan

### DeepSpeed Errors

**Symptoms**: `IndexError: pop from empty deque`

**Solution**: We use ZeRO-2 (not ZeRO-3) to avoid this
