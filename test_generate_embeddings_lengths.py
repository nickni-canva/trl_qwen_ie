Test generate_with_embeddings function with various token lengths

This test suite verifies that generate_with_embeddings handles different token lengths
correctly without causing size mismatch errors in rotary embeddings.

Test Scenarios:
1. All Short Sequences (< 512 tokens)
2. All Medium Sequences (~512 tokens)
3. All Long Sequences (> 512 tokens)
4. Mixed Lengths in Same Batch
5. Edge Cases (very short and very long)
6. Different Batch Sizes

Usage:
    python test_generate_embeddings_lengths.py
